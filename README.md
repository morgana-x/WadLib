# WadLib
A c# library for Danganronpa Wad Files

Used Spirals Documentation at https://wiki.spiralframework.info/view/WAD as reference.

Another library for WAD files!

This one is capable of
+ Extracting
+ Repacking
+ Extracting Singular Files
+ Patching (In progress, planning to have this feature allow stuff like Reloaded II mods etc that don't actually change a physical file or rebuild anything)

# WadGui
Bundled in the releases is a Gui program that lets you search and extract specific files from a selected wad file that uses the wad library

+ Press Shift + Left Control + A to select all current files in the browser
